8. Miscellaneous. You acknowledge that the Software, Documentation, technical data, and any other materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. You represent and warrant that you are not a person or entity appearing on the lists published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Treasury or any other list that may be published by the U.S. Government, as amended from time to time, that is prohibited from acquiring ownership or control of items under this Agreement, or with which BJN is prohibited from doing business. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of California. Any legal claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated hereunder or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule and shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California in each case located in the City of Mountain View and Santa Clara County, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding and waives any objection based on improper venue or forum non conveniens. Notices to be given or submitted by either party to other pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt) of (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested) or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. The parties acknowledge that they are acting as independent contractors who are solely responsible for their own actions or inactions and that no joint venture, franchise, partnership, agency, or other relationship shall be created or implied by this Agreement. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any of your obligations or performance, under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without BJN’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this provision is void. BJN may freely assign or otherwise transfer all or any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer all or any of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement without your consent. If any court of competent jurisdiction adjudges any provision of this Agreement to be to be illegal, unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable, but shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. You acknowledge and agree that there can be no adequate remedy at law for any material breach of this Agreement, which breach will result in irreparable harm to BJN, and therefore, upon any such breach or any threat thereof, BJN is entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against you (and, if applicable, your officers or employees) without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages, in addition to whatever remedies BJN might have at law. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing by non-preprinted agreements clearly understood by both parties to be an amendment and signed by each party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
